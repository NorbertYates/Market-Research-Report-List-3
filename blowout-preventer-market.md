<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blowout Preventer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Annular BOP</li><li>Ram BOP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blowout preventer (BOP) market consists of two main types: annular BOP and ram BOP. An annular BOP is a doughnut-shaped rubberized device that forms a seal by applying pressure from all directions. It is flexible and can adapt to different pipe sizes and shapes. On the other hand, a ram BOP uses hydraulically or mechanically operated rams to close around the pipe and create a seal. It is more suitable for specific pipe sizes and shapes. Both types of BOPs are crucial in preventing uncontrolled release of oil or gas during drilling operations.</p></p>
