<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Laminator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coating Thermal Laminator</li><li>Pre-coated Thermal Laminator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal laminators can be categorized into two main market types, namely coating thermal laminators and pre-coated thermal laminators. Coating thermal laminators involve the process of applying a thermal coating to a printed material, which is then passed through the laminator for heating and bonding. On the other hand, pre-coated thermal laminators use pre-coated laminating films that already have a thermally activated adhesive on one side. These laminators utilize heat to activate the adhesive, which bonds the film to the printed material. Both types provide a protective layer for documents or other materials.</p></p>
