<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Ship Unloader Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mobile</li><li>Floor Track</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pneumatic ship unloaders are machinery used in the shipping industry to efficiently and quickly unload cargo from ships. There are two main types of pneumatic ship unloaders: mobile and floor track. Mobile unloaders are portable and can be easily moved around the ship's deck, allowing flexibility in unloading different holds. Floor track unloaders, on the other hand, are permanently installed and move along a fixed track on the ship's deck, providing stability and precision during the unloading process. Both types of unloaders serve the same purpose of efficiently transferring cargo from ships to storage facilities.</p></p>
