<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Relief Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reclosing Pressure Relief System</li><li>Nonreclosing Pressure Relief System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Pressure Relief Systems market includes two main types: Reclosing Pressure Relief System and Nonreclosing Pressure Relief System. A Reclosing Pressure Relief System is designed to automatically close and reseal after relieving excess pressure, providing continuous protection against potential overpressure situations. On the other hand, a Nonreclosing Pressure Relief System does not automatically reclose once it has relieved pressure, requiring manual intervention to reseal it. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the safety and integrity of equipment and processes by preventing overpressure incidents and subsequent damage.</p></p>
