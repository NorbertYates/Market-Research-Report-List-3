<p><ul><li>Fluorinated</li><li>Non-fluorinated</li></ul></p>

It is recommended for people of all ages, especially children and those at higher risk of cavities. Non-fluoridated toothpaste, on the other hand, does not contain fluoride and is often preferred by individuals who want to avoid excessive fluoride intake or have specific dental needs. Both types serve the purpose of maintaining oral hygiene, but the inclusion or exclusion of fluoride differentiates them.</p></p>
