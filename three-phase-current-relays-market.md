<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-Phase Current Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Under-Current Detection</li><li>Over-Current Detection</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Three-Phase Current Relays market includes two types of relays: Under-Current Detection and Over-Current Detection. Under-Current Detection relays monitor the current flowing through a circuit and activate when the current drops below a predetermined threshold. This helps in protecting electrical equipment from damage due to insufficient current. On the other hand, Over-Current Detection relays identify excessive currents flowing through a circuit and trigger a protective response, safeguarding the system from potential damage caused by overloads or short circuits. Both types of relays play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and functionality of electrical networks.</p></p>
