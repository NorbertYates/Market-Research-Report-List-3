<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mango Seed Oil and Butter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold-Pressed</li><li>Expeller-Pressed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mango seed oil and butter have two main market types: cold-pressed and expeller-pressed. Cold-pressed refers to the process of extracting the oil or butter from the mango seeds without using any external heat, keeping the nutrients intact and preserving its natural properties. Expeller-pressed, on the other hand, involves a mechanical extraction method that utilizes external heat during the process. This can result in some nutrient loss due to the higher temperatures, but it is often more cost-effective. Both market types offer options for consumers depending on their preferences and desired product benefits.</p></p>
