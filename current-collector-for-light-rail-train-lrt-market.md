<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Collector for Light Rail Train (LRT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-Running</li><li>Bottom-Running</li><li>Side-Running</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the light rail train (LRT) market, there are three main types of current collector systems: top-running, bottom-running, and side-running. Top-running collectors are mounted on the top of the train and draw power from an overhead wire or rail. Bottom-running collectors are located beneath the train and make contact with a power source on the track. Side-running collectors are positioned on the side of the train and connect to power sources located alongside the tracks. Each type has its own advantages and applications within the LRT market.</p></p>
