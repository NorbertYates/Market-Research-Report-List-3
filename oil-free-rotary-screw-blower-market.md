<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-free Rotary Screw Blower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Multi Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil-free rotary screw blower market consists of two types: single stage and multi stage. In a single stage blower, the compression process is completed in one step, where air is compressed once before being discharged. This type of blower is suitable for applications requiring a lower pressure ratio. On the other hand, multi stage blowers compress the air in multiple steps, allowing for higher pressure ratios. These blowers are used in applications requiring higher discharge pressures and are often more energy-efficient than single stage blowers.</p></p>
