<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Fundus Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li><li>Non-Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable Fundus Cameras are classified into two main types based on their functionality: Mydriatic Fundus Cameras and Non-Mydriatic Fundus Cameras. Mydriatic Fundus Cameras require the dilation of the pupil for imaging, providing high-quality images of the retina but requiring the use of eye drops. Non-Mydriatic Fundus Cameras, on the other hand, do not require pupil dilation, making them more convenient for patients and easier to use in primary care settings. Both types play a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of various eye conditions.</p></p>
