<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The On-line Sodium Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Channel</li><li>Multi-Channel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-channel and multi-channel sodium analyzers are both types of online sodium analyzers used in various industries. </p><p>A single-channel sodium analyzer is designed to measure sodium concentration in a single sample at a time. It consists of a single measurement channel, where the sample is introduced, analyzed, and the sodium concentration is displayed or transmitted for further analysis or control purposes. This type of analyzer is suitable for applications where analyzing one sample at a time is sufficient.</p><p>On the other hand, a multi-channel sodium analyzer has multiple measurement channels, which allow for the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples. Each channel operates independently, enabling the measurement of sodium concentration in different samples concurrently. This type of analyzer is ideal for applications where a high volume of samples needs to be analyzed in a shorter time period, improving efficiency and productivity.</p></p>
