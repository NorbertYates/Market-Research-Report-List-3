<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Nitrogen Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compressed Gas</li><li>Liquid Nitrogen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial nitrogen gas is commonly used in two forms - compressed gas and liquid nitrogen. Compressed gas is stored in high-pressure cylinders and is suitable for applications where a continuous supply of nitrogen is needed. On the other hand, liquid nitrogen is stored at extremely low temperatures and is used when large quantities of nitrogen are required or when a more rapid cooling effect is needed. Both forms of nitrogen gas play a crucial role in various industries such as healthcare, food processing, and electronics manufacturing.</p></p>
