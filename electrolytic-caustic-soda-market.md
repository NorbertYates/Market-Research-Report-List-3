<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrolytic Caustic Soda Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mercury Process</li><li>Diaphragm Process</li><li>Ion-Exchange Membrane Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrolytic Caustic Soda market is primarily divided into three types: Mercury Process, Diaphragm Process, and Ion-Exchange Membrane Process. The Mercury Process involves the use of mercury as an electrode, which can pose environmental risks. The Diaphragm Process separates the electrolyte and product with a porous diaphragm, reducing the risk of contamination. The Ion-Exchange Membrane Process uses a membrane to separate the electrolyte and product, offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly option for producing caustic soda. Each process has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p></p>
