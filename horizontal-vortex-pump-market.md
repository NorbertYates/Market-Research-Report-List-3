<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Vortex Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Vortex Pump</li><li>Open Vortex Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horizontal vortex pumps are available in two main types â€“ closed vortex pumps and open vortex pumps. Closed vortex pumps have a casing surrounding the impeller, which prevents the pumped fluid from directly contacting the impeller. This design is ideal for handling abrasive or corrosive fluids. On the other hand, open vortex pumps have an open impeller design, allowing easier passage of larger solids or fibrous materials. Both types of vortex pumps are widely used in industrial applications for transferring fluids containing solids or debris.</p></p>
