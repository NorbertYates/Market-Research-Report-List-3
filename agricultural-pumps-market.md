<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal pumps</li><li>Displacement pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural pumps play a crucial role in irrigation and water distribution on farms. There are two main types of agricultural pumps: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotational motion to create fluid flow, making them suitable for transferring large amounts of water. Displacement pumps, on the other hand, use reciprocating or rotary motion to displace fluids, making them more precise and efficient for specific applications. Both types of pumps are essential for maintaining agricultural operations and ensuring efficient water distribution.</p></p>
