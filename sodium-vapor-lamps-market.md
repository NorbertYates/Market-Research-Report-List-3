<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sodium Vapor Lamps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure Sodium Lamp</li><li>Low Pressure Sodium Lamp</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The market for Sodium Vapor Lamps can be classified into two types: High Pressure Sodium (HPS) Lamps and Low Pressure Sodium (LPS) Lamps. HPS lamps utilize a higher pressure of sodium gas inside the lamp, which results in a higher color rendering index and increased light output. On the other hand, LPS lamps operate at lower pressure, producing a monochromatic yellow light. HPS lamps are commonly used for outdoor lighting due to their brightness, while LPS lamps are suitable for specialized applications like astronomical observatories where specific wavelength requirements exist.</p></p>
