<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Borehole Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage</li><li>Multistage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Borehole pumps are used to extract water from underground sources. The two main types of borehole pumps are single-stage and multistage pumps. A single-stage pump has only one impeller and is suitable for shallow boreholes. It is smaller and simpler in design, making it more cost-effective. On the other hand, a multistage pump has multiple impellers and is ideal for deep boreholes. It has a higher pumping capacity and can overcome higher pressure, but it is more complex and expensive compared to a single-stage pump.</p></p>
