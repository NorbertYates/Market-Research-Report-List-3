<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Cleaning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flushing</li><li>Backwash</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The membrane cleaning system market includes two main types: flushing and backwash. Flushing is a method used to clean membranes where water is pumped through the system at a high velocity to remove any accumulated debris or fouling substances. This process helps maintain the efficiency and longevity of the membranes. On the other hand, backwashing involves reversing the flow of water through the system to dislodge and remove any particles or contaminants that may have built up on the membrane surface. Both flushing and backwashing are critical for ensuring optimal performance of membrane systems.</p></p>
