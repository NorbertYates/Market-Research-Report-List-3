<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Probe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Touch Probe</li><li>Non-Contact Probe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electronic probe market consists of two main types: touch probe and non-contact probe. A touch probe is a type of electronic probe that physically makes contact with the surface it is measuring. It typically uses a small stylus or tip to accurately measure dimensions and features. On the other hand, a non-contact probe does not make physical contact with the object being measured. Instead, it uses technologies like lasers or optical sensors to measure dimensions and features without any physical interaction. Both types of probes are commonly used in precision measurement applications in various industries.</p></p>
