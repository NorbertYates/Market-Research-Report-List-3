<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Scrubbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Scrubbers</li><li>Semi-dry Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dry scrubbers and semi-dry scrubbers are types of air pollution control devices used to remove pollutants from industrial exhaust gases. Dry scrubbers typically use a dry sorbent material, such as activated carbon or lime, to adsorb or react with the pollutants. They are effective in removing gases like sulfur dioxide and acid gases. On the other hand, semi-dry scrubbers use a combination of dry sorbent and water mist to capture and neutralize pollutants. They are commonly used for controlling particulate matter emissions. Both types play a crucial role in reducing air pollution and improving air quality.</p></p>
