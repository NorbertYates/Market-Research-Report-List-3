<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Breakaway Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Separation Via Breaking Pins</li><li>Separation Via Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety breakaway couplings are devices used to ensure the safety of pipelines and fluid transfer systems by preventing catastrophic accidents. They come in two types: separation via breaking pins and separation via cable. In separation via breaking pins, the coupling is designed with pins that break when a specific force is applied, detaching the hoses or pipelines involved. Conversely, in separation via cable, a cable is used to hold the coupling together, and when a predetermined force is exceeded, the cable breaks, allowing for a safe separation. Both types aim to prevent spills, leaks, and damage, ensuring the safety of personnel and the environment.</p></p>
