<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Single Phase Water Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial single-phase water smart meters are devices used to measure and monitor water consumption in commercial buildings. There are two types of markets for these meters, namely IC card and non-IC card markets. In the IC card market, meters utilize an integrated circuit (IC) card for data storage and payment purposes, providing customers with a convenient and secure way to manage their water usage. On the other hand, in the non-IC card market, meters do not rely on IC cards and may offer alternative methods for payment and data retrieval. Both markets aim to improve water efficiency and provide accurate billing for commercial water consumption.</p></p>
